Pure House Data – Harold Al Souk 


Introduction

This track is a tribute to Can You Feel It by Larry Heard Aka Mr.Fingers

Link of the song played live on PureData: https://youtu.be/Lqg1Hlp5fSA

The idea is to play the track as if it was a live. So you start with a bass loop, and ad some drums and synth to make your improvised sequence. 

The track is composed of Drums, a bass line (inspired by one the House Music godfathers Larry Heard), an oriental sample made on Ableton, synths, and a midi piano that you can play whenever you want from your midi keyboard.

Best way to play the track 

Put the Puredata ‘ boite_rythme.pd’ and the samples 
‘DND_Hats_1’ ‘orient.wav’ on the same folder.

Click on the ‘boite_rythme.pd’ and Put the Media On (if you don’t have PureData on your computer, please download it https://puredata.info/downloads/pure-data 

Bass 
Switch on the Toggle button ‘Allumer’ on the top left
(the bass line will start, feel the groove before moving on)
You can use the Echo on the right of the bass (Pd Fm) and increase the hslider 

Drums : 
Click on the parameters CLAP, KICK and hit Ring and the message boxes (there is a click message just next to it) and increase the hslider of the sample Hat (on the right of the kick)
(you know have the bass and the drums, the base of the House Track)
 I personally Advise you to use the Kick hslider to stop it during a loop and put it again to feel the vibe)

Sample Orient (on the bottom)
Just increase the hslider
(my name is Harold Al Souk, and I’m an Electro Oriental Lover)

Piano (bottom right))
If you feel confortable with piano, you can increase the hslider of the piano and start to play with your midi keyboard or your computer keyboard)
You can also click on the random piano playing button to play random notes (I don’t recommand it’s not very groovy)

Ambient Synth (right)
Very optional the Amplitude Modulation Synth and Triangle Oscillator can bring some ambient sound on the track 
Just have to click on the message box button and increase the hsliders

Microphone (bottom)
If you have a microphone (laptop microphone is ok), you can try the microphone by increasing the hslider and click on the toggle button 
It can be better I just put it so you can think that the song needs some vocals….

Recording (bottom left)
By clicking on the Recording bang, the song that you are playing will be recorded on the folder with the name ‘myRecordtest.wav’

Hope you will enjoy the track, or at least feel some groove. It’s all about groove.
